My website is designed to be be a centralized location for activies, advice, and updates to help you get through quarantine with their sanity.  The central structure and idea of the website is complete, and the website's content can be built out overtime as people submit contributions such as recommended activities or websites.

Quarantine is hard, and I spent my first two weeks trying to find ways to stay entertained and feeling positive.  I think a site such as mine could help others by providing some of the resources and recommendations that were given to me.
